## Key Features

- **User Authentication**: Secure user registration and login functionalities using Passport.js and bcrypt for password hashing.
- **Blog Management**: CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations for blog posts, allowing users to publish and manage their articles.
- **Commenting System**: Users can comment on posts, enhancing interactivity and engagement.
- **User Profiles**: Each user has a profile where they can manage their information and view their posts.
- **Responsive Design**: The application is designed to be responsive, ensuring a seamless experience across desktop and mobile devices.
